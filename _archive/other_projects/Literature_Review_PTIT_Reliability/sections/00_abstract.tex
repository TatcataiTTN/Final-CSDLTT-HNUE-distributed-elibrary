This comprehensive literature review examines the field of satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), with particular focus on reliability improvement techniques. The primary reference is the work by Nguyen et al. (2021) from the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT), Vietnam, which proposes a novel combination of QPSK-based modulation, dual-threshold/heterodyne detection, and key retransmission for enhancing satellite QKD reliability.

\textbf{Scope:} This review covers 85+ research papers spanning from the foundational BB84 protocol (1984) to state-of-the-art developments in 2025, organized into four thematic parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction and Paper Analysis:} Detailed examination of Nguyen et al. (2021), including system architecture, mathematical framework, and key contributions

    \item \textbf{Theoretical Foundations:} Foundational QKD protocols (BB84, E91, CV-QKD) and landmark satellite experiments (Micius, integrated networks)

    \item \textbf{Technical Aspects:} Atmospheric channel models, detection schemes, error correction methods, and security analysis approaches

    \item \textbf{Analysis and Synthesis:} Comparative evaluation, research gap identification, and future research directions
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key Findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nguyen et al. (2021) achieves 20 dB power improvement over conventional schemes and $>$1000$\times$ Key Loss Rate reduction with 4 retransmissions
    \item The 3-D Markov chain model provides a novel analytical framework for link-layer reliability analysis
    \item Integration of physical layer optimization (DT/HD) with link layer mechanisms (ARQ) represents a unique cross-layer approach
    \item Remaining gaps include experimental validation, finite-key security analysis, and LEO constellation integration
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Keywords:} Quantum Key Distribution, Satellite Communication, Free-Space Optics, Atmospheric Turbulence, QPSK Modulation, Heterodyne Detection, Dual-Threshold, Key Retransmission, Markov Chain, Reliability, PTIT Vietnam
